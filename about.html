    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>My name is Jedaine Chambers, and I believe leadership starts with listening and learning. I’m currently enrolled in the Leadership and Peer Support Program at Chaminade College School. What makes me passionate about leadership is not just taking charge, but helping others grow alongside me.</p>
    <p>Over the past year, I’ve supported younger students as a peer tutor and volunteered in communities that face challenges. These experiences taught me patience, compassion, and the importance of service. I’m not just working on being a good student—I’m working on becoming someone others can depend on.</p>
