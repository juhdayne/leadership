    <p>I’m currently a Grade 11 student at Chaminade College School, enrolled in the Leadership and Peer Support Program. I'm passionate about helping others and building meaningful connections in my community. Through volunteer work and tutoring, I’ve grown as a communicator and leader, and I’m always looking to improve.</p>
