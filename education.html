    <p>At Chaminade College School, I’ve not only worked on my academics, but also challenged myself with new responsibilities. I’m proud of my strong performance in courses like English, Entrepreneurship, and World Religion — subjects that helped shape my thinking and values.</p>
    <p>I also completed a Grade 12 University-level course early: Challenge and Change in Society. It gave me a head start on understanding how society works and why leadership and change go hand in hand.</p>
    <p>Learning doesn’t stop in the classroom. Through leadership programs and volunteering, I’ve grown in confidence, perspective, and purpose.</p>
