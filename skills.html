    <h2>What I've Learned</h2>

    <h3>Communication & Collaboration</h3>
    <p>As a peer tutor, I’ve learned how to explain ideas clearly, ask good questions, and really listen. Working with Grade 9 students in English helped me realize that everyone learns differently, and it’s important to meet people where they’re at.</p>

    <h3>Time Management & Responsibility</h3>
    <p>Balancing school, volunteer work, and leadership responsibilities taught me how to manage my time. Whether it’s meeting a tutoring session or finishing assignments, I’ve learned how to set priorities and keep myself accountable.</p>

    <h3>Creativity & Technology</h3>
    <p>Whether it's making presentations, using digital tools, or managing social media, I enjoy using tech to connect and communicate. Being comfortable with technology has helped me collaborate and share ideas in new ways.</p>
