    <h2>“Learning to Lead: My Journey Forward”</h2>
    <p>If I wrote a book about my life so far, I’d call it “Learning to Lead: My Journey Forward.” That title represents how leadership isn’t something you achieve overnight — it’s something you grow into, through mistakes, small wins, and reflection.</p>
    <p>So far, my journey has included supporting others, learning from my community, and realizing that leadership is more about lifting people up than standing out. This portfolio is part of that journey — a chance to reflect on where I’ve been and where I want to go next.</p>
