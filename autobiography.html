    <h2>“Work in Progress”</h2>
    <p>If I wrote a book about my life so far, I’d call it “Work in Progress.” That title represents how leadership isn’t something you achieve overnight. It’s something you grow into, through mistakes, small wins, and reflection.</p>
    <p>So far, my journey has included supporting others, learning from my community, and realizing that leadership is more about lifting people up than standing out. I believe being adaptable and willing to learn makes me a strong candidate compared to someone who thinks they already know everything.</p>
