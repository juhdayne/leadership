    <h2>Title: "Work in Progress"</h2>
    <p>If I were to write my autobiography, it would be titled <strong>“Work in Progress.”</strong> It would reflect on my growth from being a shy student to a confident leader who isn’t afraid to help others, try new things, and make a difference in the community. I bring a strong work ethic, a calm attitude under pressure, and the ability to connect with people easily.</p>
