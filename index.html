      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my Leadership Portfolio. My name is Jedaine Chambers, and I’m a Grade 11 student at Chaminade College School. This website was built not just to share my accomplishments, but to reflect on how I’ve grown through leadership, community work, and personal challenges. Here, you’ll find the journey that shaped who I am today and the leader I’m becoming.</p>
