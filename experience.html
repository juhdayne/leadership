    <h2>My Experience</h2>

    <h3>Arbo Seniors – Technology Support</h3>
    <p>Helping seniors with technology taught me to communicate clearly and with patience. It's a reminder that leadership means meeting people where they are.</p>

    <p>I supported younger students with their English studies, developing my mentoring skills and learning how to be more adaptable.</p>

    <h3>Holland Bloorview – Volunteer</h3>
    <p>Working with children with special needs showed me the power of empathy and the importance of small, consistent actions.</p>
