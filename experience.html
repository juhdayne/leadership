    <h2>My Experience</h2>

    <h3>Learning 2 Lead – Peer Tutoring Program</h3>
    <p>Throughout the Learning 2 Lead program, I tutored a Grade 9 student in English and worked one-on-one to help them succeed. Being a tutor taught me how to support others, be patient, and communicate in ways that build trust. I've officially completed my tutoring responsibilities and earned my <strong>L2L Certification</strong> as recognition for my leadership and commitment.</p>

    <h3>Arbo Seniors – Technology Support</h3>
    <p>Helping seniors with technology taught me to communicate clearly and with patience. It's a reminder that leadership means meeting people where they are.</p>

    <h3>Holland Bloorview – Volunteer</h3>
    <p>During my time at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, I supported recreational activities and helped staff create a fun, welcoming environment. It was a space focused on healing and positivity, and I learned how to bring energy and compassion into a professional healthcare setting. The experience helped me grow in confidence, and showed me how impactful leadership can be even in quiet moments.</p>
